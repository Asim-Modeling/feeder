This directory contains the library files for POSIX Threads running on AINT,
and some example programs.

Programs using AINT pthreads must include the file include/aint_pthread.h,
and be linked with the object pthread.o in this directory. These programs
cannot be run natively as they make "fake" syscalls specific to AINT.

If source compatibility is desired, a sequence of preprocessor directives
like the following can be used:

  #ifdef CUSTOM_PTHREADS
  #include "aint_pthread.h"
  #else
  #include <pthread.h>

The list of pthreads routines currently supported is:

  pthread_create
  pthread_join
  pthread_exit

(to be updated as more functions are supported.)
