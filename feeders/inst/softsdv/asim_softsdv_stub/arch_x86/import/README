Most files in this tree come directly from SoftSDV releases.  There are
some exceptions.  Within in each release there are some release-specific
files added for Asim:

map_decoder_regs.h --
    Generated automatically from decp69.h from the SoftSDV release using
    mapregs.pl (same directory as this README file) as follows:

        mapregs.pl < decp69.h > map_decoder_regs.h


build_gcc / build_g++ --
    The commands to invoke the C and C++ compilers.  Each SoftSDV release
    may use a different compiler.
