Steve Wallace has upgraded the tracer from tracer1 to tracer2
several days ago, but did not update the changes file. Here is his
CVS commit message:

> tracer 2 now supports redirected stdin/stdout
> add external feeders directories for 'atom' 'atf' and 'tracelister' types

M feeders/ttlaint/fpoper.c

BUGFIX: restricting FP asm operations: FP operations with /S modifier set
(software trap completion) MUST NOT clobber any of their input operands with
their output. Spike has complained about our adds/suc emulation being
non-conformant.

Alpha Architecture Reference Manual, 3rd Edition, 4.7.7.3:
  ... For any instruction so marked [/S], the output register for the
  triggering instruction cannot also be one of the input registers, so
  that an input register cannot be overwritten and the input value is
  available after a trap occurs.

Several bugs related with TTL fixed.

fardanaz, Fri Apr 20 17:36:34 MET DST 2001

Ok, this time I'll try to be a bit more verbose ;-)
Fixed a bug int ttl_loader, gather/scatter guys must
clear immed picode flag to avoid trashing the EA field
of the instructions (calc in event_write / event_read).
This error was causing some wrong behaviour on TTL-PM.

--

fardanaz, Thu Apr 26 16:35:24 MET DST 2001

I added a new output file, now the feeder will dump information about
current cycle, comitted instruction, etc when an marker is reached. This
feature is enabled in Tarantula only. No overhead in ARAÑA mode.

fardanaz, Thu Apr 26 16:58:43 MET DST 2001

I pushed the max. number of markers from 16 to 64.

A feeder-related reproducibility problem fixed:
If you change "icode" size you can get small performnace differences !
This is due to the fact that we use size_of(struct icode) to dynamically alloc.
memory and these virtual addresses are used as physical addresses in the
simulated caches (both instructions and data) therefore changing ICODE SIZE
has the side effect of shift data into the simulated chaches and this produce
small performance deviations. To avoid this problem we use different logical spaces
to code and data and we alloc. a fixed chunk of memory rather than size_of(struct icode).
This last thing introduce a bit of memory overhead but will keep us free from
side effects on the IBOX when dealing with physical addresses.

When a TLB translation of an invalid VEA is needed (while executing in the
bad path), the low log2(PAGE_SIZE) bits of the VEA are copied into the PEA,
instead of always generating the PEA '0'. This is closer to what Arana does.

------------------------------ WARNING -------------------------------
This is the first checkin after a transition period in which we have
used cvs commit directly because of instabilities in the environment
when moving from Compaq to Intel. A lot more files have changed than
indicated above:

Major changes:
 * moving all (instruction) feeders into a new subdirectory feeders/inst
 * changing the ASIM configuration infrastructure such that feeders are
   treated like any other regular module; feeders are not built in a
   separate <model>/pm/feeders/ directory anymore, but rather they
   are in the "natural" place in the model's provides-requires
   hierarchy (like any other module); simple feeders are completely
   built within the ASIM module framework (that is true e.g. for ATF);
   more compilcated feeders (and any other module) can specify their
   own Makefile (e.g. AINT has its own Makefile), which will be invoked
   as a sub-make to the top-level Makefile; these changes also allow
   feeders to have sub-modules, like any other module;
 * refactoring the ATF feeder to be a more generic "trace feeder" with
   atf/alpha as just one specific trace reader plugin module; this is
   in preparation for IA64 trace reader plugin modules that will share
   the generic trace feeder infrastructure;
 * this checkin cleans up the interface between the generic trace
   feeder and the trace file specific trace reader and also introduces
   new "null" components for TraceReader, TraceInstruction, and
   TraceConverter to make sure we have clean interfaces and no hidden
   dependencies between trace feeder and the other components of the
   new framework;

- expanded information content of ia64 trace instruction for support
  of wrong-path syllables embedded in correct-path trace; this happens
  if we have a bundle based trace format and e.g. the first syllable
  of a BBB bundle is a taken branch; note that this support is still

- MLX bundle fix: following has changed
  - M syllable will get a non sequential PC target = X syllable, ie.
    will skip over the L syllable which is just long immediate data;
  - L syllable is marked as long immediate data and wrongpath
    instruction internally in the feeder; this allows the PM to either
    ignore it completely (syllable based PMs) or commit it (bundle
    based PMs), simmilar to branch syllables after taken branches;

Well, RFIs returning to the L syllable of an MLX bundle are
non-fixable in any reasonable way in the feeder, so I am revoking the
state back to CSN-feeder-39, meaning that every performance model
needs to check every instruction if it really is an instruction or
data (inst->IsTypeL() == true means that it is data).

Added UCSD PTrace reader.
NOTE: This is only an alpha version of the software, don't rely on it
yet - interfaces might still change. Since the underlying libraries
are very compilcated to build, we also rely on prebuilt libararies in
the /proj/asim area.

Added the command "nuke" to the makefile templates. "make nuke" takes
"make clean" to the extreme by blowing away everything (including the
Makefile itself) in the build directory. This is equivalent to hitting
the "clean" button in AWB.

The purpose of this checkin is to add functionality to the trace feeder
so that it can keep track of the current frame marker (CFM) and predicate
register file (PRF) state as it sequences through instructions.  As a result,
the ASIM modler will be able to determine the source 

This was accomplished by adding additional functionality to ia64ciardi.cpp
to also record both the virtual predicate register numbers and values.
Also with SP records, the entire predicate register state updates are now
recorded.  The complete current frame marker updates were already being
recorded.

This information is then used in ia64reader.cpp in function
GetNextInst().  As each subsequent instruction from the trace is
requested by the trace buffer, for each stream it keeps track of the
state of the CFM and PRF by analyzing the information given from the
ciardi trace reader.  For each instruction it "fixes" the CFM and
"updates" the PRF.  The new CFM, old PRF, and new PRF are recorded in
the internal instruction trace buffer format.  The asim feeder interface
(the "converter") then reads the CFM and PRF into the ASIM_INST class.
Note:  the ASIM_INST class has not been modified for the PRF yet, but
ia64converter.cpp has code there ready for it.

As previously mentioned, with this information the modler will be able
to read the "old" predicate register file to read the source predicate
qualifier value and determine if it was executed or eliminated.

  instead use the taken/not-taken indication from the trace
Fixed some CFM tracking bugs
  only update br.ret CFM if it's taken
  update the right parts of CFM for clrrrb and clrrrb.pr

This is a big one: over 1000 #include statements have changed - bear
with me, I'm sure I have made some mistakes ...

This checkin goes in sync with the implementation of new #include
rules in asim-core (CSN-core-130). These rules are supposed to help
prevent future name clashes with system header files.

Here is an overview of the new rules:

if header file foo.h       new syntax               old syntax
is part of ...             #include ...             #include ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
asim-core                 "asim/foo.h"              "foo.h"
provides hierarchy        "asim/provides/foo.h"     "foo.h"
(ie. synthesized by AWB)
same module               "foo.h"                   "restricted/foo.h"
another module            "asim/restricted/foo.h"   "restricted/foo.h"
(ie. illegal include)


Historically applied bandaid fixes for nameclash problems
(prefixing "asim" to a few core header files) have been unraveled:

new name            old name
--------------------------------
asim/mesg.h         asim_mesg.h
asim/instfeeder.h   asimfeeder.h
asim/basesystem.h   asimsystem.h

- modified sw_context so that it no longer has a pointer to the
hardware context it's currently mapped to.  Instead, it has a bool
value "mappedToHWC" that indicates if it's mapped or not.  This should
ease some circular include issues.

- also modified sw_context so that it gets passed a pointer to the
context scheduler, instead of using a global pointer.  This affected
context_scheduler.cpp also because it instantiates the software
contexts.

- modified the .awb files to have a better hierarchy of the
context_scheduler, hw_context, sw_context, and feeder.

- It turns out that the context scheduler class uses the software context
to keep track of the mapping to a hardware context.  As a result, removing
the link from software context to hardware context destroy's the 
context scheduler's ability to keep track of the mapping, so I had to put
that stuff back into the software context.

Apologies to Judy for breaking this.....

A hardware context now knows nothing about a context scheduler. The former
no longer asks a context scheduler to it to the context scheduler's list
of available contexts. Now it is the context scheduler's responsibility to
get a hold of a hardware context when it is created and add the context to
its list.

When the Mingo feeder is built it now creates a mingo directory at the
top level of the build tree.  The directory holds client side libraries
to be linked into instrumented programs.  The client side code is built
here instead of as a benchmark because it must be kept in step with the
Asim side of the Mingo interface.

In the future the libraries can be shared libraries instead of .a files.
We can then compile the benchmarks to depend on the shared libraries
in the mingo directory.  This will allow them to pick up the latest
version of the client-side interface without recompiling the entire
benchmark.

For now, a pseudo client (mingo/mingo_client) is also stored at the top
level of the build.  That feeder will eventually be moved to the
benchmarks area.

- Mingo client side code now stored in shared library.  This will allow us
  to change the private interface to ASIM without recompiling benchmarks.
- The feeder process gets its own main() back as a result of the change.
  Mingo client side initialization happens automatically when the library
  is loaded.
- MINGO_Program_Main() and MINGO_Program_Exit() are gone -- replaced by
  constructor/destructor functions in shared library.
- No more default feeder process.  Must specify feeder process on the
  command line.  (E.g. --feeder mingo/mingo_client)
- Arguments to Mingo code on client side now passed in environment variable
  instead of as arguments.  The shared library constructor function can see
  environment variables but had no access to argc/argv.

- GetNextSoftwareThreadEvent() now takes wait time argument in microseconds
  instead of milliseconds.

- New public functions in Mingo feeder class intended to make the
  interface more efficient by passing only the events about which Asim
  cares:

  * Fast forward (no events sent from feeder process until trigger event):
      FastForwardToIP()
      FastForwardNEvents()

  * Limit events passed from feeder to specific types (e.g. branch):
      SetEventMask()
      GetEventMask()

  * Allow smart buffering of events from feeder process so Asim never needs
    to wait for an event from the feeder process.  Buffering is automatically
    turned off when a memory fence or load lock is executed.  It is the
    scheduler's responsibility to note events that would turn off buffering
    in order to turn it back on, when appropriate.  GetRunAhead() reports
    the accurate value, including automatic setback to no buffering.  The
    default state is unbufferred.
      SetRunAhead()
      GetRunAhead()

- Fixed some deadlocks in mingo_client.c

- All code now works with gcc optimizer turned on.

- mingo_pseudo now waits for all threads to complete in an effort to get
  more consistent results.

- Add support for probing memory in the feeder process from Asim().  See

- Changed SetRunAhead() semantics.  Run-ahead no longer resets to no
  buffering when a lock sequence is seen.  Since buffering won't give
  accurate results for locks, there isn't much point in shutting the
  buffer down when we see a memory lock.  Buffering can still be useful
  for warming up caches or dumping events (e.g. mingo_dumper).

Trace Feeder:
* add totalSkippedWrongpath for debugging purposes
Trace Inst:
* add SetTrap() function
  should be used in conjunction with SetTarget() for interrupts
  instead of SetNonSeqPc()

IA64 Ciardi:
changes to bring gtrace feeder up-to-date with Ginsberg trace reader
* don't use br_action_init_traceIP
  model is ok with bogus IPs at beginning
  if we really want we could set the IP with better methods (i.e. skipping fewer lines)
* move Clear()ing of bundles to bb_action assure we don't have stale data
* get rid of "Stype" concept
  it was bogus because these types are not mutually exclusive
  thus, so was the union variable "info" so its components were split out
  a few extra flags were added to represent some of the Stype info that was actually needed
  (trap, mov pr)
* remove "heuristic illegal INT" from in_action
  this code interpreted IN records incorrectly
  specifically, the IP was not the last instruction executed, but the first one *not* executed
  (i.e. the IP that the corresponding rfi should return to later)
* add correct IN record handling
  this involves checking whether corresponding bb record was printed
  as well as searching backwards to find the last good path instruction
  this is why we need to have a bundle "window"

IA64 Reader (Gtrace)
* removed use of Stype while maintaining equivalent functionality

IA64 Reader (UCSD)
* removed (commented) reference to Stype

The page coloring algorithm allocates sequential pages in memory for each
software thread.  The algorithm is implemented as a separate page table 
for each SWC, with an offset between contexts so that multiple SWC don't 
have the same low order bits for the physical address.  The highest order
bits of the physical address are equal to the software context number. 

The FEED_ITranslate call returns a true or false, indicating whether 
a the pte was available or newly allocated, respectively.  It also sets 
a user variable passed into the problem with the generated physical address.

  For function argument (of mmptr class type) the constructor was called

  Now explicitly NULLing the mmptr before exit. However, we have about

I changed the code for address translation to be more general. The

two need FEED calls, FEED_ITranslate and FEED_DTranslate.  There are 
now 2 FEED_ITranslate calls, one with the old interface (retained for
backwards compatibility) and one with a new interface that indicates
both the physical address and whether the page was already allocated 
or not.  I've also added code to the I and Dcache in IPF that calls
ITranslate & DTranslate.

Instead of sending nop's on badpath, send "or r1=r1,r1" instead.
Should not have any side effects, and avoids an MM problem:
  If a mispredicted branch got stuck in the DRB behind a
  long-latency op (in my case backpressured st.rel instructions)
  the fake retire unit would fill up with badpath nop instructions
  and the DRB would never fill due to nop-squashing.
  Eventually we just ran out of CPU_INST's.

Added a bunch of reads, writes, and exchanges to test merging of writes,
piggybacking of read requests in the mrq, loads hitting on mgb entries.

- mingo_pseudo was generating memory exchange events with illegal VA's,
  causing a crash when mingo_dumper probed the addresses.
- event passing scheme was dropping events when thread priority events
  were passed.
- calls to request events now hang until the first event is received
  from the feeder process.  This should make simulations more consistent
  from run to run.

Changed addresses of reads to match those of exchanges (that were changed in
Michael's previous checkin). The purpose of the tests is to check the
interactions between merge buffer entries for exchange writes and 
subsequent reads.

I enabled an existing section of code that syncronizes the trace IP. 
The first n instructions are skipped by the feeder until the first
taken branch is encountered enabling the synchronization. IP-relative
branch targets are now calculated by the tang_inorder model. And without
synchronizing the first taken branch would drive us down a
bad path.

These are the files for the gambit feeder. It needs to be cleaned up

makefile template is used to compiled the feeder with the header
files from gambit. Currently pseudo wrong path is turned off. This
is a switch in the header file, I would have done it in the awb file
but the synthesized header file includes syntax.h which conflicts

disassemble limited instructions by hand to glean
CFM and PRF information from the not-so-elegant

should be a 5-10% performance boost

several gambit feeder fixes/updates to support markers and skipping
this should enable microbenchmark studies (e.g. pointer-chase)

* feed the 'L' of an MLX template instead of 'trapping' past it
  special case the fetch of the 'X' so we don't wander down badpath
* cleanup of some uses of IADDR_CLASS
* add FEED_Marker support (stolen from trace feeder)
* add FEED_Skip to marker support
  hack that compares only lower 32 bits of IP
  because TCL8.0 (thus, awb) doesn't understand 64-bit integers on x86
  NOTE: this is slow because it single-steps
        we are considering tapping into gambit's breakpoint mechanism
        to make this faster
* fix up the way we get the model back on the correct path after a skip
  no longer 'trap' the first instruction after a skip
  because this causes bb reporting to get screwed up
  instead inject a nop with the 'trap' attached to it
* cleanup unused flag WRONG_PATH
* rename START_CORRECT_PATH to justSkipped
  and don't use it at beginning of time, only after skipping

changed the iaddr usage to use the set operator instead of the
overload assignment operator. We plan to get rid of the assignment
operator since its use in confusing in the context of ipf 
where there are multiple ways of representing the syllable. 
We will force the programmer to explictly set both the
bundle and syllable addresses.

Fixed a few bugs:
* clear the breakpoint after using it, not before
  otherwise if you set a breakpoint in a loop it will keep triggering
* make marker.GetMarkerPc return the bundle *and* syllable
* add back in the wrongPath flag
  otherwise badpath might reconverge with goodpath,
  screwing up the dependency code

- changes for integrating the software context, hardware context, and

context scheduler and software context just for mingo.  The original
versions of these files had calls very specific to mingo.  Making them
all work together with 1 version of each wasn't in the scope of this
check in.

	* mingo-ctl.awb: new version of mingo.awb for models that require
	a controller. Mingo cannot require its own controller so this is
	dangerous.  This file should only be used in models that already
	have controllers.  The controller is required for calls to
	CMD_ThreadBegin() and CMD_ThreadEnd()

	* mingo_feeder.h: added union of bits structs for using the

	* mingo_pvt.h: uses this new union of bit structs (MINGO_INFO)

	* mingo_pseudo.c (main): commented out creation of two subsidiary

Added some features that should hopefully catch
insidious bugs in the future:

* the trace feeders now check to make sure that the
  model commits instructions in order
* the context scheduler checks to make sure that any
  active hw contexts for "liveness" -
  this should catch hangs in *any* model, including
  hangs because of I$ misses not returning;
  because we never FEED_Fetch in these cases, these
  hangs are not visible to a particular instruction
* also fixed the valgrind complaints with context scheduler

A fix to help avoid "Trace buffer overrun on fill" errors.
Real bug is that Commit() is not done until load data returns.
Since we retire loads early, if there aren't consumers this
makes for a large number of feeder insts "in flight."

The tracebuffer artificially limits "in flight" to half of
the BufSize.  Allow it to be up to BufSize-1 (makes for
simpler code too...).

The trace feeder was setting the CPU number.  This was a bug.  The feeder
should NEVER EVER NEVER EVER set the CPU number or the TPU number!!!!!  
That's for the timing model to do.  Hopefully, no one will put this back 
in again.

- Since TW doesn't retire nops and long immediate sylables, we don't
want to force the model to retire these.  So, I've changed the feeder
so that instructions in the feeder are tagged with as nops or long
immediates.  The model has the option of committing these to the
feeder or not.

The feeder looks to see if the current instruction the pm is trying to
commit is the next one it thinks should commit.  If not, it looks to
see if what it thinks should commit is a nop, a long immediate, or an
embedded bad path.  If any of these hold true, it advances it's
pointer and repeats the same check until it either commits the
instruction the pm requests, or asserts because it's committing the
wrong instruction.

Directory feeders/scheduler/context_sched
 context_sched.cpp         Locally Modified         435

There are two bugs with the context scheduling
a) When run with multiple slices and a fast forward cycle before
a run cycle. The scheduler will schedule the thread then
unschedule it before the chip is clocked. Thus the chip will
think that there are no active threads to run and will not
clock any of the slices. The work around for this is to run
for a cycle before any skipping is done. I have updated all
of the benchmark configurations for gambit so that they do
this before fast forwarding.

b) There was no code inside of the remove stream inside of 
the context scheduler. So when a thread is scheduled then
unscheduled and then re-scheduled it gets assigned to a new
hardware context. We changed the remove function so that
the swc was removed from the list of active software contexts
and the hwd context's software context mapping was removed.
Since the only the stream id is passed into the remove thread
this could cause a problem when there is not a one to one
mapping of swc to hwc. I also changed the ASIMERROR inside
of the remove thread to a warning, since there is the chance
of a double delete now (thread switches used to be passed
down the pipe and then processed).

Added 2 more parameters and support for probabilistic intervals
between bundles containing loads (SYNTH_RANDOM_THRESHOLD,
SYNTH_FIXED_SPACING).  I changed how the instructions are being
generated to make it a bit simpler. The code is still way too complex
and is a result of my earlier learning/misunderstanding. I'm going to
try to simplify it as I work on it more.

When SYNTH_FIXED_SPACING==0, a load bundle is *not* issued if:
     (100*drand48()) > SYNTH_RANDOM_THRESHOLD.

When SYNTH_FIXED_SPACING==1, load bundles are issued every
SYNTH_LOAD_FREQUENCY bundles.

loads. You can go through 128 registers pretty quickly when all you
are doing is loads and xors, 6 at a time -- sooner than a CBOX
response to a load miss. Now, the loads use registers r25-r127 as
destinations and the xors use r5-r24 as destinations. This will avoid
accidental WAW hazards.

Right now there is a funky ordering issue with how registers are
handed out. I make the "interesting" bundles and back fill the
unteresting bundles. That affects the ordering of the registers
handed out because I'm still using the mingo notion that there are
independent uninteresting operations. I plan to get rid of that so the
registers are handed out in a more sensible order.

- when the first instruction of a trace is an instruction that
modifies the CFM, it's not set correctly by the manufactured branch
that precedes it.  Changed it so the manufactured branch grabs the cfm
from the first real instruction on the trace.

Added SYNTH_LOAD_PCT which is the precent of memops that should be
loads. Default is 100% loads.  If it were set to 67, then 2 out of 3
memops would be loads the other 33% would be stores.

SYNTH_LOCALITY       0       Range:0..100. 
                             0=no locality, 100=only locality
                             This is a measure of reuse of previously generated addresses.

SYNTH_HISTORY_SIZE   32      Must be power of 2.

	removed MINGO_REG (using UINT32). Added some comments. Removed
	some dead code.  Added some parameter validation.

	Added load pointer chasing using the SYNTH_POINTER_CHASING
        dynamic parameter.  0 is the default -- no pointer chasing.  1
        implies there will be pointer chasing for loads. Stores are
        unaffected.

	Added the ability to bound the size of the data space
	referenced using SYNTH_DATA_SPACE. When nonzero, it is an
	exponent. For example, if you wanted to limit data references
	to 1 MB, then set this to 20.  The default is zero, which
	indicates "no limit".

I added SYNTH_SHARING_PCT in the range of 0 to 100. 0 is no
sharing. 100 is all sharing. It picks values from the history
(SYNTH_HISTORY_SIZE) of other processors.  Initially, the history is
empty, so the history must fill up a little before sharing will occur.

SYNTH_HISTORY_SIZE is set at 32 (per processor) by default. If you
want to have more shared values (or fewer) change this parameter
accordingly.

updated the tracefeeder to use asimcontextswitch in the instruction
instead of just plain contextswitch


Added a prototype of the new softsdv interface that only uses the cpuapi
of softsdv feature include:
a) only one library different from the baseline. Means that baseline
save and restore points can be used
b) gear shifting is now supported
c) hdb and ssb scripts should now work correctly and allow for easier
sampling inside of asim
d) Improved performance, especially on MP simulations
e) support for the interrupts inside of the reference model softsdv
this causes the instruction to be tagged as a feedercontextswitch.
GetContextSwitch now returns whether it was a an asim scheduler context
switch or a feeder context switch
f) there is no longer a makefile template inside of the feeder itself.
However there is still a foundation change that just links against
the softsdv libraries.
e) cleaned up the code.
once I get all the bugs worked out. This interface will replace the 
current gambit feeder.

 Also, when SYNTH_WITH_NOPS=1, I only generate NOPS as filler -- no

  - instfeeder moved from core to feeder module instfeeder_interface
  - previous module feeder is now module instfeeder_implementation

a) cleaned up a couple of awb files that was causing awb2 to
choke when trying to update the apm model for the gambit_v3 models

b) made the IFEEDER_BASE_CLASS accept a string when the feeder
is initialized to name the feeder. This string (which defaults
to null is used when stats for the feeder are printed out).
If the string is null the feeder will just dump a number
for the feeder that is based on where it is located in the
active feeders linked list

c) introduced the ability to dump stats in the feeder. Since
the feeder is not derived from the asim_module_class (base
class), I added a virtual DumpStats function to the IFEEDER_BASE_CLASS,
and a static  DumpAllFeederStats which calls this virtual
function on all active feeders. These functions use the 
same STATE_OUT that is used by the asim_module_class and
the awb.c file was changed so that the STATE_OUT was created
there and passed into both the module dump routines
and the feeder dump routines. 

d) updated the feeders derived from the IFEEDER_BASE_CLASS
to register a name... eventually this name could be added
to the Trace macro when multiple different feeders were
used.

- Allowed us to specify a priority when creating a hardware context. When
  the context scheduler looks for a h/w context to put a thread on, the
  context scheduler will pick the one with the highest priority. 

  We can also change the priorities on the fly. Though this currently won't 
  cause a thread to migrate on the fly, I don't see it being too hard to add 
  that functionality. Then we'll have an easy way to do core-rationing 
  experiments.

- Removed the function FindHWCFromUID() from hw_context.cpp. This function
  just causes problems whenever it's used. Someone always finds a way to
  misuse this function (see the asim-ipf change log for a description).

phasing out the only gambit feeder now that the new one
can support both user mode and os mode simulations (previously
there was a problem getting the newer feeder to terminate
correctly on the end of user mode program). Added an
assert into the old gambit feeder to tell the user to
use the newer version. I will eventually remove the old
one totally once I am certain there is no migration problems.

Removed the combo feeder.. redundant with Michael's efforts
to allow multiple feeder instantations. 

Fixed a small bug in the newer gambit feeder where the 
instruction count function was passed the wrong variable.

are executed in batches. It needs to take the PC from
the next instruction in the batch, not the pc after the
batch (i.e. if you are executing 16 instructions at a time
I was using the pc of the 17th instruction as the NPC of
the first instruction instead of the PC of the second
instruction)

1) if you fastforward and are batching new instructions, then you
must force the feeder to get a whole new batch of instructions
rather then using the rest of the batch from before the fastfwd

2) the nop that is generated at the end of a program thread
must be added to the refeed buffer in case that instruction
is committed (This happens in the ape model where an instruction
is committed right after it is fetch and before the end
thread is handled)

Added notion of "routines". Currently there are two routines: The main
path routine and a leaf routine. The code supports multiple levels of
routines. This was added to support studying the i-cache "way"
predictor. The documentation is updated, describing the new paramters.

Note: one parameter is removed: SYNTH_INSTS_BEFORE_BRANCH. We should
use SYNTH_STATIC_SYLLABLES_PER_ROUTINE instead. This new parameter
describes the length of a routine in syllables.

Routines are enabled by default currently. See the documentation on
aforge for more information.

The new paramters are:
    SYNTH_BRANCH_OFF_PATH_PCT = 50     
    SYNTH_BRANCH_BUNDLE_IN_ROUTINE = 4
    SYNTH_ROUTINE_OFFSET = 16384

specifies what should be in the other syllables of a bundle with a

SYNTH_ODD_BUNDLES do the same for the non-memop filler bundles.  For
details, see the the awb file and the ASIM doc on aforge -- I'm going
to commit that next.

- Added the data structures to the SWC class to hold the disassembly
        cache and the perinst stats cache. 
- Made each SWC a module so that the SWC can dump the perinst stats.

 context_sched.cpp         Locally Modified         494


To make perinst stats work, I DO NOT delete the SWC array when the
context scheduler is destroyed. This allows valgrind to run correctly
(because the valgrind benchmark doesn't return an error on memory
leaks), and gets rid of the data corruption problem associated with
the instruction trying to access its SWC after the SWC has been
deleted. This is a temporary fix, and I'll work on a cleaner fix to
the problem soon.

Added support for string parameters for specifying bundles.

SYNTH_MEMOP_BUNDLE, SYNTH_EVEN_BUNDLE, SYNTH_ODD_BUNDLE can be 3
character strings that specify syllables. Here is the encoding:

      'M':  MEMOP; // NOTE: could be load, store, or exchange
      'L':  LOAD;
      'S':  STORE;
      'E':  EXCHANGE;
      'C':  COMPARE_EXCHANGE;
      'D':  COMPARE;
      'X':  XOR;
      'N':  NOP; // NOTE: could be NOPF, NOPI, NOPM, or NOPB
      'F':  FMA;

I deduce what template to use or die if no IPF template fits.

- Next baseleve of SoftSDV feeder.  Feeds into APE though it doesn't handle
  interrupts correctly and has lots of warning messages due to SoftSDV bugs.
- Split SoftSDV feeder code into ISA neutral and specific parts.
- Import more SoftSDV .h files needed to use disassembler in cpuapi
  module.
- Remove some declarations from hdb_types.h that were duplicates of iel.h.

	Added SYNTH_ACQUIRE_PCT, SYNTH_RELEASE_PCT and SYNTH_LFETCH_HINT.
	SYNTH_ACQUIRE_PCT and SYNTH_RELEASE_PCT default to 0 and are in
	the range (0,100). The acquire percentage affects loads and the
	release prercentage affects stores. Also some atomic operations
	use these parameters (fetch-and-add and compare-exchanges).

	The fetch-and-add and compare-exchange must have either acquire or
	release semantics. So when both SYNTH_ACQUIRE_PCT and
	SYNTH_RELEASE_PCT are nonzero, there are conflicting requirements,
	unless they are both equal to 50.  I chose to use the larger of
	the two parameters. When both are zero, we default to releases.

	SYNTH_LFETCH_HINT has 4 values: "none", "nt1", "nt2", and "nta".
	The default is "none". To emit an lfetch use the letter "P", for
	"prefetch" in SYNTH_MEMOP_BUNDLE.

DTranslate() now takes an ASIM_INST instead of a hardware context number.
For most feeders this makes no difference since the ASIM_INST can be
used to look up a hardware context number.  For feeders that have actual
translation information (e.g. SoftSDV), having the ASIM_INST associated
with the memory simplifies the translation.

- I am addicted to virtual functions:  feeder ITranslate() call now requires
  a stream handle.  Did I have to change all the other feeders?  No.  The
  default instance of the new function calls the old one.
- Added both data and instruction translation to SoftSDV feeder.
- Gave in and added an ISA indepenent module for the SoftSDV feeder.  It
  was getting to be too many files.
- A bunch of improvmenets to the SoftSDV setup script.

- Data virtual to physical translation sometimes fails in SotSDV when there
  is a TLB miss.  It will be followed by an interrupt.  Make up a fake
  page 0 physical translation when PA is 0.
- Merge a bunch of different benchmark configuration files into a single
  perl "database" file for each workload.

- Use 80 bit FP in SoftSDV simulation instead of 82 for speed.  (Drops
  2 bits from exponent.)
- Add arguments to page coloring code constructor to permit modification
  of page size and starting physical address that are configurable for
  each instance of the class.  The defaults are unchanged and still
  respond to configuration in the .awb file.  SoftSDV needs to guarantee
  page sizes are identical to its internal algorithm and needs pages
  to be allocated in a physical space that won't clash its own page
  coloring.

Added ability to include dependent uses for load destinations.  This
slows the machine's request rate. Before the loads had no uses.
The three new parameters are:
      SYNTH_DEPENDS_ON_LOAD   
      SYNTH_DEPENDENT_RANGE_START 
      SYNTH_DEPENDENT_RANGE_STOP  

You can basically specify what percent of loads have dependent uses and
the range of bundles for the use distance.
See synthetic-feeder.awb and the online documentation (when it gets updated)
for their meanings.

Setup the softsdv_replay buffer to return the number of real instructions
that were implicitly committed with an instruction (i.e. leading NOP
instructions).

- Somebody (not me) changed SoftSDV feeders to supply register values by
  default.  Not a good thing.  Either change the dynamic parameter during
  a run or use the feeder_softsdv_ipf_values feeder.
- Asim now sets an environment variable before invoking SoftSDV so
  Asim stub in SoftSDV can really be sure it is supposed to talk to Asim
  instead of running stand-alone.

Setting physical data and instruction PCs in the ASIM_INST directly,
because the only address translator module we have (pagecoloring) does
not do the right thing in this case. SoftSDV has the correct physical
addresses. Possibly, we should write a SoftSDV address translator
module, but this was much easier for now.

Bug fix:
* bug was that SP (set predicate) records were being interpreted
  as physical predicate register values (as mov =pr returns) --
  turns out SoftSDV/LIT generated virtual predicate register values
* fix this bug using the pregs_v2p function

Related addition:
* Pin-generated traces had SP records with physical predicate registers.
  To fix, add ability for trace reader to re-dump trace it reads in,
  allowing callbacks from feeder to fix up trace problems (in this case,
  HackSPRecord).  This infrastructure is commented out under the tag
  #if 0 /* CIARDI_DUMP */.  It's more complex than it might sound given
  the buffering that the trace reader does.

- SoftSDV - Asim interface now produces the same result from run-to-run.
  Previous versions did not guarantee identical runs on multi-CPU simulations,
  though each run was a valid order.
- New SoftSDV release (v20030921_0).  The old release (v20030312_0) is still
  supported.
- Many more feeder statistics stored in stats file:  number of kernel
  instructions, number of timer interrupts, number of context switches,
  and counts of tagged NOP instructions.

- Add a mode to SoftSDV for disabling cross-CPU data sharing.  This should
  probably be moved to the hardware context code.
- Add a log of processes executed in the functional model on each CPU.
  This will be moved to the hardware context manager once I add more to
  the feeder interface.

- Move collection of simulated process data to the hardware context so it
  can be used by any feeder.  Process history is now stored as an array in
  the stats file by hw_context.
- Add interface to feeder for requesting the value of a cache line following
  a memory operation.  There is a new IFEED_MEMORY_VALUES capability that
  should be set if a feeder supports memory values.  In SoftSDV values
  are enabled with the dynamic SOFTSDV_MEMORY_VALUES parameter.
- Add syntax to specify the offset to the pid and process name fields in
  the Linux task_struct, to which AR6 always points.  The offsets can
  change between Linux releases.  Offsets are now stored in setup-softsdv
  and passed to the Asim/SoftSDV stub at run-time using a painfully
  convoluted route in the SSB script.
- Increase the number of instructions executed in Oracle to 1 billion,
  a number insanely large so SoftSDV always keeps running until the limit
  specified on the command line or the experiments file is reached.

- New algorithm for dropping instruction virtual to physical translations
  on a context switch.  Previous code didn't invalidate old translations
  on a switch.  Doesn't seem to affect performance.
- Track timer interrupts cycles in the HWC.  The current tracking is
  from the first commit of the interrupt handler to the commit of the
  rfi.  As a result it doesn't track the cost of switching to the interrupt
  context.

Added SYNTH_CODE_SPACE to limit the addresses generated by instruction
references. This is the number of bits in the address that may be
used.

Limiting the ITranslate() and DTranslate() functions to
SYNTH_CODE_SPACE & SYNTH_DATA_SPACE bits, by masking to work around
the hardware TLB walker references.

Set the default code and data spaces to 49 bits to match what TWD
implements, in the "synthetic-feeder.awb" file.

 hw_context.cpp            Locally Modified         603

- Modified to match the new way of identify an injected instruction.
 Now the hardware context checks the instruction's flag instead of
 checking the pointer to the software context.

- Little modification in Dtranslate function to use always the address
 translator when the instruction is injected by the model.

- Support for new CPUAPI interface in upcoming SoftSDV release.
- Makefile that builds Asim stubs for SoftSDV now figures out which
  versions need to be build dynamically.
- Linux guest workloads can now build swap and tmp_user disks.
- Asim now invokes softsdv/run instead of hdb directly.  This allows
  SoftSDV configuration to use debuggers other than hdb (e.g. ssdv
  and Perl scripting).

By request changed the names of the SYSTEM_EVENT_CLASS and SYSTEM_EVENT_TYPES
to FEEDER_SYSTEM_EVENT_CLASS and FEEDER_SYSTEM_EVENT_TYPES

Also InjectSystemEvent went to HandleSystemEvent since for feeders like softsdv 
you can't choose when to make the side effects in the feeder visable at a 
certain time.

GetSystemEvent went to IsSystemEventTypePending and GetNextSystemEventType
to make it more obvious that we are only asking about what is next and not handling
it.

- fixed the context scheduler so that it doesn't fail when a trace
ends.  This used to work, but was broken when the feeder skip feature
was fixed.  The skip feature is now broken!  It was pretty brain dead
to start with and really needs to be re-thought with a better way to
do it.  In addition, the code controller calls the feeder twice when a
trace ends (one method does nothing), and that needs to be fixed also.
Just an FYI for whoever fixes it.

- removed all of the mt scheduling code from feeder because it didn't
belong here.  Also, there was another copy that was newer in the twd
package.

Add dynamic param to treat the first N instructions from traces as
warm-up data.  N_TRACE_WARMUP_INSTRS defaults to 0.  We should add syntax
to trace files to mark warm-up regions, but this is a first step.

Also fix a bug in the SoftSDV warm-up code.  Load/store access size was
always 8.

New IPF feeder focused on memory instructions that can be used to set and run specific
micro-benchmarks (i.e. a sequence of addresses to the same R$ slice, bank and index).
It uses special trace files to generate sequences of loads and stores.
The trace is a text file which consists of a succession of lines with the following format:

     <operation_type> <@> <access_size> <byte> <hint>

Where the fields are:

    operation_type: r/w (read/write)
    @: base logical/physical address in hexadecimal
    access_size: 1/2/4/8
    byte: address offset
    hint: 0/1/2/3 (NONE/NT1/NT2/NTA)
 
The trace files are specified using the command line parameters (after --feeder).
The number of running threads is set using the dynamic parameter NEM_THREADS.

( short example of a trace:
    r 6230e780 1 0 0
    w 62496780 1 0 3
    w 6261e780 1 0 3

    r 6292e780 1 0 0

- Synthetic feeder extended to allow the possibility of selecting different
 configurations per thread. Numeric parameters have been converted into an
 array of numbers (between blank spaces) that contains the values per thread.
 These arrays are parsed at initialization time. In the case of having
 less values than threads the last value is extended for the remaining threads.

Lots of configuration changes for new SoftSDV version.  SSB scripting replaced
by Perl which caused lots of changes.  Also preliminary support for configuring
the IA32 version of SoftSDV.

- Workload descriptions removed from setup-softsdv and replaced by lots of
  command line arguments.  The arguments are now stored in .cfg files.  I'm
  hoping this simplifies creation of new workloads and makes it easier
  to have site-specific workloads.
- Switch workload setup to Perl scripting in SoftSDV.
- User-mode environment (no simulated OS) now uses latest version of SoftSDV.

Allow either a workload CFG file or an option to the run script to
limit the number of warm-up instructions to a value lower than is
available in a checkpoint.  SoftSDV fast forwards past the unwanted
warm-up region.  This lets us keep rather large warm-up areas in
checkpoints without having to use them now.  In the future we could
use large warm-up areas while simulating the same region.

some more tweaks for the x86 land. We can't go as far as we did in fast 
clock speed or else the timer does not work correctly.

To fix this I added an arch data member to the config data structure that 
is used by the perl scripts to control softsdv

In asim.pm I made it look to see if the workload was x86 and if so
only go 150 million instructions

- Change default SoftSDV versions to ww28 patch releases
- Restructure feeder for multiple ISAs.  This check-in just moves the IPF
  directories to arch_ipf subdirectories and adds some levels to the awb
  hierarchy for ISA specific code.  The Makefile.template that builds the
  Asim CPUAPI library works for any ISA and automatically adjusts itself
  for multiple SoftSDV releases within an ISA.

added a peek function to query about the instruction at an address without fetching it.
This is primarily needed by the front end of x86 pipelines that need to know how many
instructions they have actually fetched so that they can make some decisions. 

I created a peek information class and I also moved the feeder system event class into 
its own file. Not that both of these .h files are private in the awb file and included
in the header file. I just didn't want to pollute the instfeederbase.h file, which 
is already large.

Have DTranslate always return a translation even when none is provided
by SoftSDV.  This is the way it worked before my last change, though
we should probably fix it for translations missing due to TLB miss
in SoftSDV, since it will trap and reexecute.

- Some x86 feeders request a particular start address when they create
  threads.  The start address from a thread is now passed to the SW_CONTEXT
  and exported by SW and HW contexts via GetResumptionPC().

Stop failing when the context switch history exceeds the limit of the number
of rows in the histogram.  Histograms don't support dynamic resizing.  Long
simulations may hit the limit.

The limit remains the same (5000 entries) but it is now controlled by a
dynamic param (PROCESS_HISTORY_BUCKETS).  In addition, when the limit is
exceeded all counters are written to the last bucket and a warning is
emitted for every context switch after the limit.  Yes, yes, I know it
is potentially obnoxious to emit so many errors, but it won't be enough
to fill a disk.  I want the warning to be noticed and burying one message
in the middle of the output doesn't do it for me.  I'm sure we'll revisit
this if it becomes a problem.

- Clean up feeder interface a bit.  Get rid of nearly duplicate
  constructor, global variable outside the class (!)...
- Add latest SoftSDV interface files for x86 release with memory values.
- Read memory values from SoftSDV CPUAPI interface.

- Add a new ring for passing register values from SoftSDV to Asim.  Using
  the standard instruction ring would have used too much memory.
- Generalize the fetch queue from Asim to SoftSDV to be a command queue.
  Added some startup commands for describing registers that should be
  monitored.  The new queue could also be used to request memory values
  in the middle of a run, though at a large performance cost.

- Feeder base class thread starting logic now:
  - Automatically walks the feeder hierarchy and associates new threads
    with the root feeder.  This enable macro feeders to create threads
    where a micro feeder is the entry point from a model.
  - Automatically maintains a count of the number of active threads.
    The Archlib micro feeder uses this to figure out how many contexts
    to allocate without having to macro feeder command line arguments.
- Remove "subfeeder" bit from the feeder base class constructor.  Replace
  it with a pointer to the parent of the feeder.
- SoftSDV
  - Pass the decoded string of a macro instruction since it was
    available already.
  - Add support for reading memory values to the feeder interface.

Add new versions of ITranslate and DTranslate which take a new parameter,
a pointer to a PAGE_TABLE_INFO structure.  This returns information about
the page table hierarchy backing the translation such as the number of
levels, the address of each level, the size of the page table entries,
the page size, whether the page table addresses are physical or virtual,
and whether the walk completed or there was an intermediate aborting
condition.

This can be used by timing models which desire to model the performance of
a hardware page walker.

Next steps are to actually use this in a model (ape footprint?) and
integrate it into the handling of page-split accesses (i.e. the
MEMORY_VIRTUAL_REFERENCE class).

Move storage for memory reference values up a level.  It used to be stored
with the class describing the memory range, where it logically belongs.
Unfortunately this lead to large inefficiencies, since the maximum reference
size on x86 is 512 bytes but the typical reference size is much smaller.
Instructions now share a pool of about 600 bytes for their access values,
saving nearly 2KB per instruction.

- Update SimPoints code to use new ISAX library instead of periodic sampling
  in the debugger.  All branches are now sampled and the performance is
  much better.
- Detect virtual regions that cross physical pages in the CPUAPI code.
  SoftSDV does not correctly report the second page.
- Move special case handling of floating point stack registers to the
  CPUAPI client.
- Stop building the old library for the beta release.

- the context scheduler was written with the express purpose of
allowing more software contexts than hardware contexts.  Someone put
in some code with no comments or explination, and the last thing this
code did was assert if there were more SWC than HWC!

I've moved the assert into the offending code so that at least it doesn't
cause the rest of the  models problems.

- Track spin loops in the HW context using PAUSE instructions as the clue
  that the code is spinning.  Attempt to differentiate between spinning
  in the idle process, spinning on kernel locks and user space locks.
- Improve detection of the current process on 64 bit Linux.
- Add a hierarchy of local LIB directories to permit updating libraries
  without breaking simulations that are running.  The problem is caused
  by NFS not holding reference counts on a shared library.  If the library
  is replaced the program starts to swap out of the new copy instead of using
  the stale copy.

- Count idle loop cycles while sampling for SimPoints
- Drop checkpointing while computing SimPoints.  It was too ugly and complex
  and likely not to be needed when we finally use DeX.
- Implement OS statis for SLES 9 on x86_64

Add support for running on 64 bit kernels.  The SoftSDV process remains
32 bit, so this is somewhat messy:
  - Force data structure alignment to be the same in shared memory
    buffers.  Default 32 bit layout is NOT natural for 64 bit objects!
  - Add SoftSDV version specific environment setup files.  SoftSDV
    hard-wires the Perl paths and some hackery is needed to get it
    running on SuSE 64.
  - Remove SYSTOKEN from the SoftSDV release path.  It made no sense
    at that point in the path.  We can put version-specific files
    lower down in the tree if they are ever needed.
